# Scala-x
The aim is to use scala as a tool, for its simplicity and can work in jvm.

* Use scala to visit source,such as db, web site, file
* Use scala to serve
* Use scala to parse all kinds of file, such as json file, xml file, java source file(?), yaml file

# Visit source 

## Http request
See https://github.com/goldbrown/scala-x/blob/main/doc/HttpRequest.md

## Visit mongodb 
See https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/driver-scala/getting-started/quick-start/

## Visit file
Use Java File IO API
See https://github.com/goldbrown/scala-x/blob/main/doc/FileOperation.md

# All kinds of format
## Json
See https://github.com/goldbrown/scala-x/blob/main/doc/Json.md
## Xml
## Excel
If we want to read/write excel file, we can use java library, apache poi. Yes, this is the advantage of java library system.
See https://poi.apache.org/components/spreadsheet/quick-guide.html#NewWorkbook

# Web server
To support web service, we will use Play framework.
See https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/Tutorials

# Scala collection convert to java collection
In order to convert scala collection to java collection and vice versa, we can use CollectionConverters in scala (I use scalaVersion "2.13.5")
